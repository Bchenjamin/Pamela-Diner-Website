# Pamela-Diner-Website

This was a course project intended for students at Carnegie Mellon University to get hands-on experience with building a website froms scratch. The website
uses mostly HTML and CSS with basic Javascript functions. 

The purpose of this project was to take an existing website from a business and redesign the website that focused on web accessibility and more aesthetically
pleasing layout. 

To get started, please open the folder and open the file: index.html.
